# Bad Words Checker

A replacement for the old SIF Bad Word Checker by GrygrFlzr and Caraxian.
You can use this checker here: https://suyo.be/sifas/badwords/

The word list was generated by trying all combinations of the letters a-z using bruteforce up to a given length, plus
testing [the List of Dirty, Naughty, Obscene, and Otherwise Bad Words maintained by chucknorris-io](https://github.com/chucknorris-io/swear-words/)
against the game's word filter.

Obviously, a content warning is in effect for wordlist.json, as it contains a lot of slurs and offensive terms in a bunch of languages.
